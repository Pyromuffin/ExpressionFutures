# Expression Optimizers

TODO

Typical patterns emitted by reduction
Limited options to optimize in the expression space
More generally useful, move to separate assembly?
Options to optimize at instruction level (IL or common emitter for compiler and interpreter)
Comparison to C# optimizations
Expense of closures and async state machines in expressions vs compile-time
